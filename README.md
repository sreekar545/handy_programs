# dynamic-logroller

Dynamic Logroller (Single executable, plain old C program, portable to any OS)

  This program is created to "replace" tee command or any other stream handler you have been using to redirect the output   of your application logs. It dynamically rolls the logs so you don't need to restart your application to roll the logs.
